1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,270
In the previous lesson we learned that
classes are reusable, so

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,860
we're able to target more than one element
with a single class selector.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,610
Now the other thing we need to know about
classes is that an element can

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,730
have multiple classes assigned to it.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,210
So let's take a look at a practical use
case for using multiple classes.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,060
At times, we may have a lot of repeated
CSS in our style sheets.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,900
So sometimes, it's best to create classes
for the repeated styles.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,450
For instance, here's a simple example.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,390
So let's say that our primary content in
footer elements need to

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,280
have the same top border styles as the
secondary content element.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,320
Now should we repeat this border top
property two more times in

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,670
our style sheet by adding it to the
primary content and footer rules?

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,450
The short answer is, no we shouldn't.

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:01,870
So what if instead, we created a new class
called t-border for top border.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,360
Then, we'll add this border-top
declaration to the .t-border rule.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,515
So, I'll just go ahead and remove the one
inside .secondary-content and

17
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:18,870
paste it inside the .t-border declaration
block.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,450
So now, we can save our style sheet, and

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,790
in our HTML we can add that .t-border
class to those elements.

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:35,460
So right after the primary-content value,
we'll add a space then write t-border.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,960
And now we can do the same for our
secondary-content class.

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,770
So we'll scroll down to the div on line
24, and right

23
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,080
after that secondary content class we'll
add a space, and add the t-border class.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,670
So, for our footer, we'll need to add a
class attribute,

25
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,110
because currently it only has an ID.

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,850
So, right after the ID of main footer,
let's add a class attribute, and

27
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,970
then we'll make the value t-border.

28
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,980
Okay, so now when we save our index.html
file and

29
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,510
refresh the preview, there we have the
border styles in our primary content,

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,420
secondary content and main footer element.

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,760
And what's great is that we only had to
write the top

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,850
border declarations once in our style
sheet.

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,660
So doing this makes our CSS more
maintainable,

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,120
especially on larger sites because we're
not unnecessarily repeating lines of code.

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,460
So say we had to change the border color
from lightgrey to something like blue.

36
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,160
Well instead of changing the color in
three different selectors,

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,230
we only need to change it in one.

38
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,740
Now in a later course,

39
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,810
we'll get into the specifics of why we
should avoid repeating a lot of CSS.

40
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,370
For now, just know that it makes things
more maintainable for us.

41
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,640
So let's change our top border color back
to lightgrey.

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,300
And since this secondary content rule is
no longer in use, we can just go ahead and

43
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,560
delete it from our style sheet.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,480
So one more important thing we need to
know about class selectors is,

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,150
we're able to apply both a class and an ID
to an element.

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,620
In fact, we did that earlier in the
footer.

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,000
As we can see we have the ID of
main-footer and the class of t-border.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,150
And we did it up here in our header
element.

49
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,230
We have an ID of top and a class of
main-header.

50
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,390
But let's keep in mind that IDs carry more
weight than classes,

51
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,530
because they refer to something very
specific.

52
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,010
So if an element has an ID and a class
applied,

53
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,360
the styles defined in the ID selector will
always carry more

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,580
weight than the styles defined in the
class selector.

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,370
And if we're not careful about how we use
classes and

56
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,060
IDs, we can end up overriding styles in
class selectors.

57
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,370
That's why we need to make sure we do not
share the same

58
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,992
properties between classes and IDs.

59
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:06,540
And I'll show you a quick example of what
can happen.

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,775
So back in our style sheet, if we scroll
up,

61
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:12,450
I'll just write this above main-header.

62
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:20,670
If we target the ID of #top, then give the
element a background color of red.

63
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,480
So we will say background-color, and make
the value red.

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,370
When we save our style sheet and refresh
the preview.

65
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,820
We can see how the red background color
and

66
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,520
the ID overrides the one in the class
selector.

67
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,090
So again, we need to make sure that
elements are not sharing the same

68
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,970
properties in a class and an ID.

69
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,696
So I'm actually gonna remove the ID
selector of #top, since we

70
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:53,463
don't want it conflicting and overriding
the styles in the main-header class.

71
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:59,219
